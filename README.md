Write an AI to parse sentences and extract noun phrases.
A common task in natural language processing is parsing, the process of determining the structure of a sentence. This is useful for a number of reasons: knowing the structure of a sentence can help a computer to better understand the meaning of the sentence, and it can also help the computer extract information out of a sentence. In particular, itâ€™s often useful to extract noun phrases out of a sentence to get an understanding for what the sentence is about.
In this problem, we use the context-free grammar formalism to parse English sentences to determine their structure. 
This project was done as a part of the CS50AI course offered by Edx and Harvard University.
